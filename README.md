mobile-calendar
===============
Prototype for a mobile calendar, done for iOS class.
* Some transitions rough and/or funky--need improvement
* Scroll from first screen to view day's events (first event anchors as well)
* Tap on date to return to top
* Tap on 15 to view week, scroll anywhere
* Zoom to view month. 
* Navigation through views should allow pinch/zoom throughout, like Maps: but currently need to tap week to return to week view
